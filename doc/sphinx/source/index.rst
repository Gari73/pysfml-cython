   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to pySFML 2 - Cython's documentation!
=============================================

A new Python 2/3 binding for SFML 2, made with `Cython
<http://cython.org>`_.  Most features of SFML are currently available,
but this is still a work in progress.  Feel free to report any issue
you encounter.

You can find the source code, downloads and the issue tracker here:
https://github.com/bastienleonard/pysfml2-cython

Currently the reference mostly lists the available classes, their
members, and information specific to this binding.  For more detailed
documentation, please see the `SFML 2 documentation
<http://sfml-dev.org/documentation/2.0/annotated>`_.  The mapping
between SFML and this binding should be fairly easy to grasp.

.. note::

   Make sure you read the :ref:`caveats` page, so that you know what
   the most important current limitations.
