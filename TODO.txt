- Optimize audio streaming.

- Add an empty RenderWindow constructor, to let the user delay the
  window creation.

- Add in-place operator overloads in Time, and possibly in other
  classes that I forgot.

- Convert Unicode arguments to UTF-8, instead of requiring Python 3
  users to use byte literals all the time.
