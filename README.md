# pySFML - Cython

This project hasn't been updated in a few years, so compilation with any recent version of SFML should fail. This seems to be the go-to Python binding nowadays: https://github.com/Sonkun/python-sfml

I recently looked at the state of SFML and it seemed like it wouldn't be too much work to update the binding. However, I'm not sure there is any demand for it.

## Overview

This is a pythonic binding for SFML 2, which supports Python 2 and 3.
This library allows you to write multimedia applications or games with
a simple Python API.
