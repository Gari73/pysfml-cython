0.1.1:

- The seconds(), milliseconds() and microseconds() functions are
  removed. Use the Time constructor with keyword arguments instead,
  e.g. milliseconds(200) becomes Time(milliseconds=200).
- Made Sprite more straightforward to inherit, __cinit__() won't raise
  errors because it automatically gets passed the constructor
  arguments anymore.
- Fixed a bug in Time where some arithemtic operators would always
  raise an exception.
- Fixed a bug in RenderStates where internal attributes and properties
  got mismatched because they had the same name.
- Added a __repr__() method in Time (mostly to have more readable unit
  test errors, __str__() already existed in the past).
- Documentation: added a "caveats" page, and a new tutorial for people
  who are coming from a C++ SFML background.
- Added some unit tests.

0.1:

- The module is now called sfml. To keep using the sf prefix, import the module
  with “import sfml as sf”.
- Python 3 users don't need to use bytes instead of strings anymore. When a C++
  method expects a byte string and the user passes a Unicode object, it is
  encoded to a byte string with sfml.default_encoding (UTF-8 by default, you can
  change it as needed).
- Added the Listener class.
- Added audio streaming (still lacking performance-wise).
- Added Texture.copy_to_image().
- Improved examples.
- Fixed various bugs and memory leaks.
