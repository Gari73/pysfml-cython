0.1:

- The module is now called sfml. To keep using the sf prefix, import the module
  with “import sfml as sf”.
- Python 3 users don't need to use bytes instead of strings anymore. When a C++
  method expects a byte string and the user passes a Unicode object, it is
  encoded to a byte string with sfml.default_encoding (UTF-8 by default, you can
  change it as needed).
- Added the Listener class.
- Added audio streaming (still lacking performance-wise).
- Added Texture.copy_to_image()
- Improved examples.
- Fixed various bugs and memory leaks.
